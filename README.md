## What is Sunder?

Sunder is a lightweight, native desktop music player that streams from YouTube without the bloat. Built with Tauri v2 and Rust, it uses a fraction of the memory that Electron-based alternatives consume while delivering a buttery smooth UI with hand-crafted animations.

The name says it all: to *sunder* means to split apart. We split the music from the surveillance.

## Features

- **YouTube search** with instant results and FTS5-powered local caching
- **Native audio playback** via rodio, talking directly to ALSA/PipeWire/Pulse
- **Explore** personalized recommendations built from your listening history
- **Playlists** with full CRUD, drag-and-drop reordering, and quick-play
- **Queue management** with shuffle, play next, reorder, and auto-advance
- **Prefetching** silently pre-downloads next tracks for gapless playback
- **Warm animated UI** with spring physics, staggered entrances, glow pulses, and micro-interactions
- **~15MB binary** with release optimizations (LTO, strip, single codegen unit)
- **Zero telemetry**. Nothing leaves your machine except YouTube search queries

## Install

### Arch Linux (AUR)

```bash
# Source build
yay -S sunder

# Prebuilt binary
yay -S sunder-bin
```

### Debian/Ubuntu

Download the `.deb` from [Releases](https://github.com/FrogSnot/Sunder/releases):

```bash
sudo dpkg -i sunder_*_amd64.deb
```

### Other Linux

Download the `.AppImage` from [Releases](https://github.com/FrogSnot/Sunder/releases):

```bash
chmod +x Sunder_*.AppImage
./Sunder_*.AppImage
```

### Windows

Download the `.exe` installer from [Releases](https://github.com/FrogSnot/Sunder/releases).

### macOS

Download the `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/FrogSnot/Sunder/releases).

### Runtime Dependencies

[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) must be installed and on PATH:

```bash
# Arch
sudo pacman -S yt-dlp ffmpeg

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install yt-dlp ffmpeg

# macOS
brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg

# Windows (scoop)
scoop install yt-dlp ffmpeg
```

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Shell | **Tauri v2** | Native webview, no bundled browser. ~100x lighter than Electron |
| Frontend | **Svelte 5** | Runes-based reactivity, zero virtual DOM overhead |
| Audio | **rodio 0.19** | Pure Rust audio with symphonia decoders (MP3/AAC/FLAC/Vorbis/WAV) |
| Extraction | **yt-dlp** | Reliable stream URL resolution, community-maintained |
| Database | **SQLite + FTS5** | WAL-mode for concurrent reads, full-text search on cached tracks |
| Build | **Vite 6** | Sub-second HMR, optimized production builds |


### Why this beats Electron music apps

1. **Memory**: Sunder idles at ~40MB. Electron apps start at 200MB+.
2. **Startup**: Native webview launches in milliseconds. No Chromium cold-start.
3. **Audio**: rodio talks directly to your OS audio stack. No Web Audio API jank.
4. **Privacy**: yt-dlp runs locally. No Google account, no tracking cookies.
5. **Size**: The release binary is ~15MB. Electron apps ship 150MB+ of Chromium.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** (stable, 2021 edition)
- **Node.js** >= 18
- **yt-dlp** and **ffmpeg** installed and on PATH

Linux dev dependencies:

```bash
# Arch
sudo pacman -S webkit2gtk-4.1 base-devel libappindicator-gtk3 librsvg pango atk

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev build-essential curl wget file libssl-dev libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev
```

### Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FrogSnot/Sunder.git
cd Sunder
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

### Build

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

The optimized binary lands in `src-tauri/target/release/sunder`.

## UI Design

Warm, golden-tinted dark palette designed for long listening sessions:

- **Base**: Deep warm blacks (`#0f0e0d`, `#181614`)
- **Accent**: Burnished gold (`#e0a820`) with ambient glow effects
- **Animations**: 11 custom keyframe animations including spring physics, staggered cascades, equalizer loaders, and floating idle states

Every interaction has tactile feedback. Buttons snap with spring easing, tracks lift on hover, active items pulse with a warm glow.

## Data

The database is stored locally in platform-specific locations:

- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/com.sunder.app/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\com.sunder.app\`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/com.sunder.app/`

Audio is cached temporarily in `/tmp/sunder/` and automatically reused on replay.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Local track downloads with library management
- [ ] Lyrics display
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts / media key support
- [ ] System tray with mini player
- [ ] Audio equalizer
